UdaanMithra

UdaanMithra is an offline-first, multilingual learning platform built to reduce the gap between rural and urban education.

This project started with a simple question:
What happens to learning when internet access becomes a limitation instead of an enabler?

The MVP you see in the video is my attempt to answer that.

What UdaanMithra Is About

Many students in rural and low-connectivity regions struggle not because of lack of interest, but because access to consistent learning resources is unreliable. UdaanMithra is designed with that reality in mind.

Instead of assuming constant internet access, the platform prioritizes offline learning, simple design, and language inclusivity — so students can focus on learning, not loading screens.

Core Idea

* Learning content should be accessible even without the internet
* Students should be able to learn in their preferred language
* Technology should support teachers, not replace them
* Progress tracking can help identify disengagement early and reduce dropouts

MVP Highlights (as shown in the demo)

* Offline-first learning experience
* Multilingual support for better understanding
* Student-friendly interface designed for ease of use
* Teacher-side visibility into student activity and progress

Demo

The YouTube video linked with this repository is the MVP demonstration of UdaanMithra.
It showcases the working flow, core features, and the overall vision of the platform.

Why This Matters

Education should not depend on geography or bandwidth.
UdaanMithra is a small step toward making learning more inclusive, practical, and accessible — especially for students who are often left out of digital-first solutions.

Project Status

This project is currently at the MVP stage, built to demonstrate feasibility, user flow, and impact potential. Future iterations can expand features, scalability, and real-world deployment.
